# Development Service
Here some files that allow the construction of a minimal viable service. It is only intended for development of the package and allows to verify interactively how changes in the source code affect a service, which is particularly important for code segments that are hard to test, like e.g. related to the interactive documentation.

Furthermore, the development service serves as a test case for the generic service tests defined in [esg/test/generic_tests.py](../../test/generic_tests.py).
